Introduction
Welcome to the Elewa website repository! In this project, I have focused on creating the social-impact, invest, and about-us pages. My tech stack includes Vite for React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository


git clone git@github.com:Bsquiat1/elewa-assessment.git

2. Change into the Project Directory


cd elewa-assessment

3. Install Project Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies, run:


npm install

4. Development Server

To start a local development server, run the following command:


npm run dev

This will initiate the development server, making your application accessible at a specific URL (typically http://localhost:5173). You can view your application in your web browser.
