## Introduction

This is the Elewa website and I have worked on the, social-impact,invest and about-us page. I have used vite for react, typescript and tailwind css for styling.



## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up and running your application. Include installation steps, configuration, and any other necessary details. For example:

1. Clone the repository:
  
git clone git@github.com:Bsquiat1/elewa-assessment.git
Change into the project directory:


Install project dependencies using npm:


npm install
Development Server
To start a local development server, run the following command:


npm run dev
This will start the development server and make your application accessible at a specific URL (usually http://localhost:5173). You can access your application in your web browser.
